# Overview of Code Structure
To help users better understand and use our codebase, we briefly overview the functionality and implementation of each package and each module. Please see the documentation in each file for more details. 

## Scripts
* [assemble.py](../assemble.py) is an auxiliary script to assemble two MUNIT generators to a new one for inference. Specificly, it will export a new MUNIT generator which consists of the content encoder and the decoder in generator A and the style encoder in generator B.
* [distill.py](../distill.py) is a script for distillation. The distiller supports ResNet and SPADE models (with option `--distiller`: e.g. `spade`, `resnet`). You could specify the teacher model with options `--teacher_netG` and `--teacher_ngf`, and load the pretrained teacher weight with `--restore_teacher_G_path`. Similarly, You could specify the student model with options `--student_netG` and `--student_ngf`, and load the pretrained student weight with `--restore_student_G_path`. We also support pruning before distillation. You just need to specify the model you would like to prune with options `--pretrained_netG` and `--pretrained_ngf`, and load the weight with `restore_pretrain_G_path`. 
* [evolution_search.py](../evolution_search.py) is a script for evolution searching. Once you have get your supernet weight, you can use this script to search for the best performed subnet. It will load a saved supernet model from `--resotre_G_path` and save the searching results to `--output_dir`.
* [export.py](../export.py) is an auxiliary script to extract a specific subnet for a supernet and export it. You need specify the  supernet model with`--model` and `--ngf` and the model weight with `--input_path`. To extract the specific subnet, you need to provide the subnet configuration with `--config_str` and the exported model will be saved to `--output_path`.
* [get_real_stat.py](../get_real_stat.py) is an auxiliary script to get the statistical information of the ground-truth images to compute FID. You need to specify the dataset with options `--dataroot`, `--dataset_mode` and the direction you would like to train with  `--direction`. 
* [latency.py](../latency.py) is a general-purpose test script to measure the latency of the models. The usage is almost the same as [test.py](../test.py).
* [merge.py](../merge.py) is an auxiliary script to merge multiple searching results. It is usually used in manually-split parallel searching.
* [remove_spectral_norm.py](../remove_spectral_norm.py) is an auxiliary script to remove the spectral normalization of the GauGAN model.
* [search.py](../search.py) is a script for evaluating all candidate subnets. Once you have get your supernet weight, you can use this script to evaluate the performance of candidate subnets. It will load a saved supernet model from `--resotre_G_path` and save the evaluation results to `--output_path`. See the our training tutorials of [Fast GAN Compression](tutorials/fast_gan_compression.md) and [GAN Compression](tutorials/gan_compression.md) for more details.
* [select_arch.py](../select_arch.py) is an auxiliary script to parse the output pickle by the [search.py](../search.py) and select the architecture configurations you want.
* [test.py](../test.py) is a general-purpose test script. Once you have get your model weight, you can use this script to test your model. It will load a saved model from `--restore_G_path` and save the results to `--results_dir`.
* [train.py](../train.py) is a general-purpose original model training script. It works for various models (with option `--model`: e.g., `pix2pix`, `cycle_gan`) and different datasets (with option `--dataset_mode`: e.g., `aligned`, `unaligned`). See the our training tutorials of [Fast GAN Compression](tutorials/fast_gan_compression.md) and [GAN Compression](tutorials/gan_compression.md) for more details.
* [train_supernet.py](../train_supernet.py) is a script for the "once-for-all" network training and finetuning. The "once-for-all" network supports ResNet and SPADE models (with option `--supernet`: e.g. `spade`, `resnet`). Like distillation, you could specify the teacher model with options `--teacher_netG` and `--teacher_ngf`, and load the pre-trained teacher weight with `--restore_teacher_G_path`. Similarly, You could specify the student model with options `--student_netG` and `--student_ngf`, and load the pre-trained student weight with `--restore_student_G_path`. Moreover, you need to specify the candidate subnet set with option `--config_set` when training a supernet. When we are fine-tuning a specific subnet, you need to specify the chosen subnet configuration with option `--config_str`.
* [trainer.py](../trainer.py) is a module that implements the training logic for [train.py](../train.py), [distill.py](../distill.py) and [train_supernet.py](../train_supernet.py).

You need to implement four functions: `__init__` (initialize the class, you need to first call `BaseDataset.__init__(self, opt)`), `__len__` (return the size of dataset), `__getitem__`ã€€(get a data point), and optionally `modify_commandline_options` (add dataset-specific options and set default options). Now you can use the dataset class by specifying flag `--dataset_mode dummy`.  Below we explain each file in details.

It assumes that two directories to host training images from domain A `/path/to/data/trainA` and from domain B `/path/to/data/trainB` respectively. Then you can train the model with the dataset flag `--dataroot /path/to/data`. Similarly, you need to prepare two directories `/path/to/data/testA` and `/path/to/data/testB` during test time.
